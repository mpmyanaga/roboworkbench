<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>Getting started with this application really means getting started with a hardware robot. Reference should be made to
hardware specific help files to get a particular robot set up. Working with the RoboConsole probably comes after you
have the little fellow charged and running about and want to get to grips on a deeper level. There are two fundamental ways to
engage with the application:</p>
<ul><li>As the user of an existing robot extension.</li>
<li>As a developer of the system.</li></ul>
<p>As a user of the system you'll need a set of application plugins to support your hardware. At the time of writing the only robot
supported is the <b>Surveyor SRV1</b>. This is a well made little machine created by the <a href="www.surveyor.com">Surveyor Corporation</a> 
and packing some fairly powerful vision technology. Really its a platform for experiments with robotic vision. The SRV1 specific help files
can add a little colour and detail.</p>
<p>As a developer there are many ways to engage at a code level:</p>
<ul><li>Adding small extensions to an existing robot plugin set</li>
<li>Adding a new type of robot by creating your own set of plugins</li>
<li>Joining in the open source effort to develop the application itself</li></ul>
<p>In this <i>Getting started</i> set of help files we'll give an overview of all of these means of engagement.</p>
