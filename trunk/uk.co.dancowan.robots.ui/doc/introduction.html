<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Roboworkbench grew out of my needing a tool to help visualise what my SRV1 was 'seeing'.
Initially I wanted to see what was in the colour bins so I could understand the blob detection
and neural networking functions. I wanted to be able to <i>grok</i> my robot's perceptual world
in order to be able to write better code for it's behaviour.</p>
<p>I've worked with the Eclipse framework professionally for years now so that seemed like a no-brainer
choice to me for a quick visualisation UI. Of course, Eclipse being what it is all these other
opportunities arose. OSGI and the plugin framework are great for extensible modular systems. I could
code a nice pico-C editor, how about other robots? So my original idea has bloated a little yet is
perhaps a more interesting project. I've enjoyed it anyway.</p>
<p>I feel I have to acknowledge the UI which ships with the Surveyor SRV1 Robot and a UI created by
**** called ******. Both have been to some extent inspirational in showing my needs to be done and
what can be done. Thanks Guys.</p>
