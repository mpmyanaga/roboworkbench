#Introduction to RoboWorkbench.

= Introduction =

Initially I just wanted to hack some tools together to help visualise what my Surveyor SRV1 robot was 'seeing'. Then, given that I'm in management these days and haven't cut any code in a while, I decided to do a 'nice' job of using Eclipse. Eclipse being what it is the project could then expand with my imagination.


= Details =

The initial upload comprises of three Eclipse plugin projects:
  * uk.co.dancowan.robots.hal
  * uk.co.dancowan.robots.ui
These two make up the base system. Extending this system to the SRV1 robot requires:
  * uk.co.dancowan.robots.srv

Its worth being familiar with Eclipse and the RCP framework:

And also worth a look at the Surveyor SRV1 robot platform:
