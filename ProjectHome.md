# RoboWorkbench #

The aim of this project is to build an extensible platform for programming and playing with my collection of small autonomous robots.

I chose the Eclipse platform as a basis because it is itself an easily extensible framework with a great deal of development power. I've used the RCP framework professionally for several years too which kindof makes it a no-brainer choice.

Initially I wanted to create a set of tools for visualising what my Surveyor SRV1 robot 'sees' with its camera and feature detection algorithms. This work is still in early stages. Extension to other robot platforms such as the Sun Spot will be forth comming (I hope).

_This is an early stage project_. Some ideas about the sort of things I'd like to put in place can be found on the project wiki [ideas](http://code.google.com/p/roboworkbench/wiki/Ideas) page.

The version of the plugins uploaded to the repo work on my machine and enable interaction with my SRV1. Needless to say (its in the license after all) this is all _utterly without warranty._

## Getting Started ##

There is a [page](http://code.google.com/p/roboworkbench/wiki/GettingStarted) on the project wiki describing the tools I use and how I get this to run. Please have a look because if you just check the code out it probably wont do much apart from throw exceptions.

## Getting Involved ##

Well, its open source so that must be part of the idea! I have no intention of adding a second robot class until the SRV1 work is done and dusted - may take a while (I have a job and family). There are some SRV1 ideas on the [ideas](http://code.google.com/p/roboworkbench/wiki/Ideas) page of the wiki and I'm open to other suggestions. Contact me: dan@dancowan.co.uk
