#Ideas for things to do next.

# Introduction #

The following is list of large features I'd like to build one day. Further discussion and plans for each of this ideas may be linked from the idea itself.

## Possibilities ##

  * Complete the Neural Networking tools
  * Complete a full set of SRV1 commands
  * Build a decent Pico-C editor for the onboard interpreter
  * Extend the above editor to handle the firmware development process
  * Write additional console-like tool for the Matchport wireless
  * Properly document loads of stuff
